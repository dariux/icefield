Python Glacier client for large files

This is a stripped-down version of the Glacier backup tool "bakthat" by Thomas Sileo (https://github.com/tsileo/bakthat).
Icefield is intended for *simple* backup and administration of large files to Amazon Glacier. 
Don't use it for anything important yet, it has not been tested (use bakthat or glacier-cli instead)

I intend to add automatic inventory bookeeping through SimpleDB or DynamoDB in the future.
